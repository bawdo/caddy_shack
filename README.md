# caddy_shack

CaddyShack is a CLI tool that helps to deploy and manage a locally running
caddy instance.

The purpose of this is so an engineer can easily spin up a local project and
register that project with caddy and have https and stable/distinct local URLs
for these projects.

This is a helpful wrapper around the Caddy API that helps do things like:

- De/Register a new backend web service
- ...
- ...

CaddyShack also simplifies installing caddy (via docker) keeping it running,
checking on it's status/health etc, and to update the docker image without
losing configuration.

CaddyShack only manages the locally running caddy server via the API.

## Install

```
go install github.com/bawdo/caddy_shack@latest
```

## Prerequisites: local DNS for `.test`

CaddyShack issues HTTPS URLs under the `.test` TLD (reserved by RFC 2606, safe
to use locally). macOS does not resolve `.test` by default, so a one-time DNS
setup is required before registering backends.

The recommended approach uses `dnsmasq` and the macOS resolver mechanism:

```
brew install dnsmasq
mkdir -p $(brew --prefix)/etc/dnsmasq.d
echo 'address=/.test/127.0.0.1' > $(brew --prefix)/etc/dnsmasq.d/caddy_shack.conf
sudo brew services restart dnsmasq

sudo mkdir -p /etc/resolver
echo 'nameserver 127.0.0.1' | sudo tee /etc/resolver/test
```

Verify:

```
dscacheutil -q host -a name anything.test
# expect: 127.0.0.1
```

A future `caddy_shack doctor` command will detect and fix missing DNS
configuration automatically.

## Usage

```
caddy_shack version
```

## Development

Run the local pre-CI gauntlet before pushing:

```
make pre-ci
```

Auto-fix formatting along the way:

```
make pre-ci-fix
```

Install a local build into `$GOBIN`:

```
make install
```
